---

### Code Explanation

- The homepage was built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and visual specifications from a **Figma** design file.
- The structure is divided into **three primary sections**, mirroring the Figma layout for consistency and responsiveness.
- Each layer and component from Figma (dimensions, spacing, colors, fonts) was carefully translated into semantic HTML and custom CSS.
- **SVG icons** were exported from Figma for scalability and directly embedded or linked in the HTML.
- Product images and assets were downloaded and organized within the `/images` folder for efficient project management.
- The **Inter Tight** font family was imported via a `<link>` tag from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.googleapis.com) to match the typography used in the design.
